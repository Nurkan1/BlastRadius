# BlastRadius

> Live impact map of Claude Code edits across your repos.
> Watches what Claude touches, paints the heat in real time, propagates
> change through your import graph, and shows the diff on click.

---

## What it does

BlastRadius is a **local-only dashboard** that observes every file your
Claude Code session reads, writes, or edits, and paints it on a tree
of your repository:

- **🔴 red** &nbsp; — Claude just edited this file.
- **🟢 green** — Claude just read this file (no changes).
- **🟡 yellow** — this file imports something that turned red (the
  "blast radius").
- **⚪ cold** &nbsp; — nothing happened.

It also tracks how much of your repo was touched in different time
windows (current iteration, last hour, full session) and shows the
**git diff** of any red file inline.

It's **read-only** on your repositories. The server never writes to
your code; it only reads files, watches for changes, and runs
`git diff`. The only file it ever writes is its own preferences at
`~/.blastradius/preferences.json`.

### What it does NOT see

BlastRadius is wired specifically into **Claude Code's hook
system**. It does not see:

- Edits made in VSCode, Notepad, JetBrains, Cursor, or any other
  editor or IDE
- File saves from build tools, formatters, or git operations
- Anything happening before you installed the hook

If you make a change to a file by hand and BlastRadius shows nothing,
that's expected. It only lights up for Claude Code's `Read` / `Write` /
`Edit` tool invocations.

### AI Agent Observability (e.g., Antigravity)

While BlastRadius is natively wired into Claude Code's hook system, other advanced agentic AI assistants (such as Google DeepMind's **Antigravity**) can participate in this observability matrix. Because external agents run in independent execution environments without native hooks, they can register their read/edit actions by calling our external CLI utility:

```bash
node scripts/log-external.js --path src/server/routes.js --tool Read
```

This immediately appends the action to the daily JSONL log with the `antigravity-session` identifier. The BlastRadius dashboard will pick it up live and attribute the action directly to `Antigravity` under the **Platform/Agent filter**, allowing human developers and multiple AI agents to collaborate with full visibility of their shared impact footprint.

## Quickstart (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** in your `PATH`
- **git** in your `PATH` (used by the diff viewer)
- **Claude Code** installed (the CLI or desktop app)
- **Windows** (the launcher is a `.bat`; the rest of the codebase is
  cross-platform, but the install script is PowerShell)

### 1. Install BlastRadius

```bash
cd C:\Users\YOU\Documents
git clone https://github.com/Nurkan1/BlastRadius.git
cd BlastRadius
npm install
```

### 2. Install the hook in each repo you want to observe

```powershell
.\scripts\install-hook.ps1 -ProjectPath C:\path\to\your\repo
```

This creates `<repo>/.claude/settings.json` with a `PostToolUse`
hook that fires after every Claude Code `Edit` / `Write` / `Read`.
The log directory is **baked into the hook command**, so no
environment variable setup is required.

Re-running the script is idempotent — only the BlastRadius entry
is replaced; other hooks in `settings.json` are preserved.

> ⚠️ Claude Code reads `.claude/settings.json` once at **session
> start**. If you have a Claude Code session already open in that
> repo, **restart it** for the hook to take effect.

### 3. Start the dashboard

```cmd
run.bat
```

or with a clean slate (wipes preferences + logs):

```cmd
run.bat CLEAN=1
```

Open <http://localhost:7842>.

### 4. Walk through the first-run wizard

The dashboard asks for a **parent directory** that contains the
repos you want to observe (e.g. `C:/Users/YOU/Documents`).
BlastRadius scans up to 3 levels deep looking for folders that
contain a `.git/` entry.

After the wizard, the dropdown in the header lists every repo it
found, with active ones (recent events) on top and idle ones
greyed out at the bottom. You can click any of them at any time
to switch the dashboard's focus.

### 5. Use Claude Code as you normally would

Every `Edit` / `Write` / `Read` Claude does on a hooked repo lands
on the dashboard in **under 3 seconds**.

## AI agent feedback via MCP

Since `v1.0.0-rc3`, BlastRadius ships an embedded **MCP (Model
Context Protocol) server** at `http://localhost:7842/mcp`. Any
MCP-capable agent — Claude Code, Antigravity 2.0, a custom
Anthropic SDK client — can consult the live BlastRadius state and
answer questions like "what did I do in the last iteration?",
"summarize today's progress", "what's the diff of the last red
file?". **Strictly read-only**; no agent can close iterations or
switch repos from MCP in this phase.

The full protocol contract, tool / resource list, NO-DATA error
shape, and protocol-version negotiation rules live in
[`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md). The quick setup is below.

### One-shot setup with `install-hook.ps1 -RegisterMcp` (`v1.0.0-rc4`+)

If you're already running `scripts\install-hook.ps1` to install the
touch-event hook, the new `-RegisterMcp` flag registers the MCP
server in the matching agent's global config in the same pass:

```powershell
# Both Claude Code and Antigravity in one go
.\scripts\install-hook.ps1 -ProjectPath C:\projects\myrepo -Agent both -RegisterMcp
```

This writes to `%USERPROFILE%\.claude.json` (Claude Code) and
`%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\config\mcp_config.json` (Antigravity 2.0).
Idempotent and preserves every other server already registered.
See [`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md#option-a--one-shot-setup-via-install-hookps1--registermcp-v100-rc4) for details.

### Connect Claude Code to BlastRadius manually

If you'd rather not use the installer, with the dashboard running
on `:7842` and the `claude` CLI on your PATH:

```powershell
# Register the MCP server (one-time, per user)
claude mcp add --transport http blastradius http://localhost:7842/mcp

# Verify it connected
claude mcp list
# → blastradius   http   http://localhost:7842/mcp   ✓ connected

# Inspect what's exposed
claude mcp get blastradius
# → lists 4 tools + 5 resources + 1 templated resource
```

In any Claude Code session afterwards (even in a different repo),
you can ask things like:

> *"Use BlastRadius to summarize my current iteration."*
>
> *"List the last 5 BlastRadius iterations and tell me which files
> were hottest."*
>
> *"Read `blastradius://heat/session` and identify any unexpected
> red files."*
>
> *"Get the diff of `src/server/heatEngine.js` via BlastRadius."*

Claude Code picks the right tool / resource on its own; you don't
need to memorize names.

### Connect Antigravity 2.0 to BlastRadius

Drop the following into the project's `.agents/mcp.json` (Antigravity
reads MCP servers from this file alongside the existing
`.agents/plugins/blastradius/` hook):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "blastradius": {
      "transport": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:7842/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Antigravity does **not** hot-reload MCP config — run `/reload` in
the agent (or restart it) for the new server to register. The
existing `plugin.json` + `hooks/hooks.json` from the hook installer
are untouched; MCP is additive.

### Connect a custom Anthropic SDK client

```ts
import { Client } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js'
import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js'

const transport = new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(
  new URL('http://localhost:7842/mcp'),
)
const client = new Client({ name: 'my-tool', version: '1.0.0' })
await client.connect(transport)

const summary = await client.callTool({
  name: 'get_iteration_summary',
  arguments: {},
})
console.log(summary.structuredContent)
```

### What the agent can call

| Surface | Name | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| Tool | `get_iteration_summary` | Current iteration metrics + per-file activity |
| Tool | `summarize_progress` | Per-file Edit/Write/Read aggregation since a timestamp |
| Tool | `list_recent_iterations` | Iteration windows derived from event gaps |
| Tool | `get_file_diff` | Validated git diff of one file (same validator as `/api/diff`) |
| Resource | `blastradius://health` | Server status, uptime, active repo |
| Resource | `blastradius://iteration/current` | Current iteration fused with summary |
| Resource | `blastradius://repo/active` | Active repo path + name |
| Resource | `blastradius://repos` | All detected repos under `parentDir` |
| Resource | `blastradius://events/recent` | Last 100 events on the active repo |
| Resource | `blastradius://heat/{window}` | Heat map for `session\|iteration\|hour\|day` |

**Lifecycle:** the MCP server lives in the BlastRadius process. When
you close the dashboard, MCP goes with it. (A future phase will ship
a stdio shim so agents can boot a headless instance on demand.)

**Rate limit:** 100 burst, 30/sec sustained on `/mcp`. Agents that
exceed it get `429 rate_limited` with `Retry-After`.

**Mutations:** none in this phase. Closing an iteration or switching
repos remains UI-only until Phase 3 gates them behind explicit MCP
consent metadata.

## Daily use

### Workflow

1. **Open the dashboard** in a browser tab and leave it. (It's
   harmless even when the server is the only thing running — no
   network calls, no analytics, just a tab.)
2. **Work with Claude Code** in any repo where you installed the
   hook. The dashboard updates live.
3. **Click red files** to see exactly what changed (git diff in
   a side-by-side viewer).
4. **Press `Alt+I`** to toggle the *iteration panel*. When you
   start a new piece of work, click "Marcar fin de iteración" to
   reset the iteration clock — the panel then shows you metrics
   for the new iteration only.

```

| UI element | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Repo dropdown** | The active repo. Switch any time without reloading. |
| **`auto` / `manual` pill** | When `auto` is on (default), the server switches the active repo if another repo gets sustained activity (≥30s span). Click to disable. |
| **`Iteration` / `Hour` / `Session`** | Time window for the heat colors. "Iteration" = since last reset (or last 3 min). "Hour" = last 60 min. "Session" = no time filter (everything today). |
| **🔴 N 🟢 M 🟡 K** | Live counters for the current window. |
| **RADIUS X%** | `(red + green + yellow) / totalFilesInRepo × 100`. Higher = more of the repo is "hot". |
| **LIVE / RECONNECTING** | SSE connection status. If it says reconnecting for more than a few seconds, the server probably crashed. |
| **`⌥I` button** | Open or close the iteration panel. Same as the `Alt+I` keyboard shortcut. |

### The iteration panel

The right panel (opens with `Alt+I`) breaks down the **current
iteration** with:

- N edited files / M read files
- K files affected by import propagation
- Blast radius % of the repo
- Time since last activity
- Start timestamp of the current iteration
- A red **"Marcar fin de iteración"** button that resets the
  iteration to "now". The next iteration starts from there.

## Glossary

### Colors

| Color | Trigger | When it's assigned |
|---|---|---|
| **Red** | `Edit` or `Write` event | A direct mutation by Claude Code. |
| **Green** | `Read` event with no Edit/Write on the same file | The file was inspected but not changed. |
| **Yellow** | Transitive importer of a red file | BFS over the **reverse** import graph (1–3 levels deep, configurable). Only red files propagate; reads do not. |
| **Cold (no color)** | Nothing in this window | The file is not in the heat map at all. |

### Windows

| Window | Time range |
|---|---|
| **Iteration** | Events at or after the last "Marcar fin de iteración" click. If you never clicked it, defaults to the last 3 minutes. |
| **Hour** | Last 60 minutes. |
| **Session** | All events in the current day's log file. No time filter. |

### Repo states (in the dropdown)

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **🟢 active (pulsing dot)** | Currently selected. |
| **active (not pulsing)** | Has events in the last 7 days. |
| **idle (greyed out)** | Detected as a `.git/` directory but no events recorded yet. |

---

## Multi-repo

BlastRadius is designed to observe **multiple repos at once**.

- The hook is installed per-repo (run `install-hook.ps1` once
  per repo). They all write to the same shared log directory.
- The dashboard always shows **one repo at a time** ("the active
  repo"). The dropdown lets you switch.
- With `auto` on, the server switches the active repo when
  another repo gets sustained activity (≥ 2 events spanning ≥30s
  in the last 60s).
- The import graph is built per-repo and cached for 5 minutes.
  Switching repos triggers a graph rebuild for the new one in
  the background (red/green show up immediately; yellow lands a
  second later).

### How to add a new repo to the dashboard

1. `./scripts/install-hook.ps1 -ProjectPath C:\path\to\new\repo`
2. Restart any Claude Code session already open in that repo.
3. Edit any file with Claude Code → the repo flips from idle to
   active in the dropdown.

### How to remove a repo

1. Delete `<repo>/.claude/settings.json` (or just the BlastRadius
   entry if you have other hooks).
2. The repo stays in the dropdown until it falls out of the 7-day
   activity window. The dashboard never deletes anything on its
   own.

---

## Troubleshooting

### The dashboard is empty after editing files

1. **Did you restart Claude Code?** The hook is loaded once at
   session start. Sessions opened before you ran `install-hook.ps1`
   never fire it.
2. **Is the hook actually invoked?** Check the JSONL log:
   ```cmd
   type C:\Users\YOU\Documents\BlastRadius\logs\session-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
   ```
   If lines are being added when Claude edits files, the hook
   works and the issue is somewhere on the server.
3. **Is the server still running?** The header badge should say
   `LIVE`. If it says `RECONNECTING` for more than 30 seconds, the
   server crashed. Run `run.bat` again.

### `run.bat` fails: "node not found"

Add Node 18+ to your `PATH`, or edit the bat to use the full path
to `node.exe`.

### The yellow propagation never shows anything

First check `/api/health` and look at the `graph` field:

```cmd
curl http://localhost:7842/api/health
```

- `graph: { modules: 0, builtAt: 0 }` → the import graph never built.
  Most common cause: `dependency-cruiser` choked on a config file.
  Check the launcher console for a red `graph rebuild FAILED` line —
  it includes the underlying error.
- `graph: { modules: <N>, builtAt: <ts> }` with N > 0 → the graph is
  fine; you simply haven't edited a file with consumers in the
  current iteration window.

Other reasons yellow stays empty:
- Your codebase needs **static imports** that `dependency-cruiser`
  can resolve. Pure-JS repos work out of the box. TypeScript repos
  need a valid `tsconfig.json`.
- For other languages (Python, Go, Rust, …) there is no built-in
  parser, so the graph is empty and you'll see red/green but
  never yellow. That's a known limitation.

### The counter says "6 red" but I only see 2 red files in the tree

Make sure your server is on a recent build (the header banner will
say *"Server running stale code …"* if it isn't — restart `run.bat`).
The fix that intersects the heat map with the on-disk tree shipped
in commit `b3ee9b8`; before that, events for `.gitignored` builds,
`node_modules`, or deleted files inflated the counter without ever
appearing in the rendered tree.

### Iteration panel shows "0 files" but I'm actively editing

Your Claude Code session might be running with a different cwd from
the repo you're editing. That used to break attribution, but the
fix in `d54eb77` switched the event-to-repo filter from a strict
`cwd === repoPath` match to "the touched file lives inside the
repo." Confirm the server has that commit (check `/api/health`'s
`serverStartSha`), then verify a touched file actually lives under
the active repo's directory tree.

### Multiple BlastRadius servers piling up after closing the cmd window

Fixed by `5e3f817`: `run.bat` now writes the server PID to
`~/.blastradius/server.pid` on boot and kills the previous one (plus
any `node src/server/index.js` zombies that have no PID file) before
starting a new instance. If you still see drift, run
`tasklist | findstr node` and `taskkill /F /PID <pid>` by hand —
that's the same belt the launcher uses.

### "Server running stale code" banner won't go away

You probably committed a fix on disk but didn't restart the server.
The banner stays until `serverStartSha` (captured at boot) matches
the on-disk HEAD again. Stop the server (Ctrl+C in the launcher),
run `run.bat`, hard-reload the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R), and the
banner clears.

### Hot-reload for development

```cmd
npm run dev
```

uses `node --watch`. Edits to anything `src/server/index.js`
transitively imports trigger a restart. The launcher logs flash
through every restart, so the stale-server banner in the browser
will surface naturally if a restart fails.

(`node --watch` is stable from Node 22; on Node 18.x / 20.x it
prints an experimental-feature warning that we suppress with
`--no-warnings`.)

### I want to change the parent directory

In the dropdown menu (where you switch repos), click
**⚙ Change parent directory…**. A small modal lets you point at
a different directory. If the current repo is no longer a child
of the new parent, the wizard runs again to pick a new repo.

### How do I wipe everything and start fresh?

```cmd
run.bat CLEAN=1
```

This deletes `~/.blastradius/preferences.json` and clears the
JSONL log. The next start drops into the wizard.

### Where are the logs?

Daily JSONL files in `<BlastRadius>/logs/`. The path is fixed at
install time (via the `-LogDir` parameter of `install-hook.ps1`)
and baked into the hook command in `<repo>/.claude/settings.json`.

### API summary

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/health` | Liveness probe + diagnostics |
| `GET /api/tree` | Repo tree of the active repo |
| `GET /api/heat?window=iteration\|hour\|session&platform=all\|claude\|antigravity\|manual` | Heat map + metrics, optionally filtered by platform |
| `GET /api/events` | Server-Sent Events stream |
| `GET /api/diff?path=…&against=auto` | Validated git diff (HTML); see "Diff modes" below |
| `GET /api/iteration` | Current iteration marker |
| `POST /api/iteration/close` | Advance the iteration marker |
| `GET /api/repos` | Detected repos under parentDir |
| `GET /api/repos/active` | Currently active repo |
| `POST /api/repos/select` | Switch the active repo |
| `GET /api/preferences` | Full prefs + `needsSetup` flag |
| `POST /api/preferences` | Merge into prefs (validates parentDir) |

### Diff modes (`/api/diff?against=…`)

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` (default) | Try uncommitted changes first; if the working tree matches HEAD, fall back to the last commit that touched the file. Modal title states which one is shown. |
| `HEAD` | Diff the working tree against the current HEAD only. Phase-4 behavior; useful when you specifically want "what's not committed yet". |
| `<sha>` / `<branch>` / `HEAD~N` | Diff against an explicit ref. Refs are whitelisted against `[A-Za-z0-9_./@~^-]{1,100}`. |

The response always carries a `source` field (`uncommitted`, `commit`, `untracked`, or `ref`) plus a short SHA when a specific commit is shown.

### Security model

- **All paths in `/api/diff` and `/api/repos/select` are
  validated.** Three layers: reject NUL bytes, reject absolute
  paths, reject anything that resolves outside `repoRoot` /
  `parentDir`.
- **git is invoked via `simple-git`'s argv-style API** — no shell
  interpolation. The `against` parameter is whitelisted against
  `[A-Za-z0-9_./@~^-]{1,100}` so a malicious `?against=HEAD;rm -rf /`
  is rejected before git is touched.
- **The repository graph is never exposed** by any API endpoint.
  It stays internal to the server.
- **No CORS headers.** The dashboard is intended for `localhost`
  only.
- **No authentication.** Per the threat model in `CLAUDE.md`, this
  is a local-only developer tool. Do not expose it to the
  internet.

## Tests

```bash
npm test        # vitest run — 183 tests, ~2 seconds
```

Coverage at a glance:

| Suite | Tests | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `log-touch.test.js` | 35 | Hook IO, path normalization, JSONL append, CLI args |
| `heatEngine.test.js` | 35 | Pure heat computation across all windows + edge cases |
| `heatEngine.propagation.test.js` | 13 | Yellow propagation against a fixture repo |
| `graphResolver.test.js` | 26 (2 POSIX) | Dependency-cruiser wrapper, BFS, cycles, fan-in |
| `diffProvider.test.js` | 25 | Path traversal, ref injection, integration against a real git repo |
| `preferences.test.js` | 21 (2 POSIX) | Persistence, atomic write, corruption recovery |
| `repoDetector.test.js` | 28 (2 POSIX) | Multi-repo scan, activity ranking, auto-switch logic |

POSIX-tagged tests cover symlink and `chmod` behavior that's not
testable on Windows without elevated permissions.

## Limitations

1. **Only Claude Code.** Edits from other editors / build tools
   are invisible. By design — the data source is the Claude Code
   PostToolUse hook.
2. **Windows-focused tooling.** The `.bat` launcher and `.ps1`
   installer are Windows-specific. The hook and server are
   cross-platform, but porting the launcher to bash is a small
   to-do.
3. **No auth, no remote.** Localhost only. The threat model
   assumes a single user on a trusted machine.
4. **Per-machine config.** The hook command in
   `.claude/settings.json` contains an absolute path to the
   BlastRadius checkout. Each contributor must re-run
   `install-hook.ps1` after cloning.
5. **Yellow propagation needs static imports.** Languages without
   a dependency-cruiser parser (Python, Go, Rust, …) get an
   empty graph. Red and green still work fine.
6. **Single-day log files.** The hook rotates to a new JSONL at
   midnight (local time). If you keep the dashboard open across
   the day boundary, you'll see the eventStore re-load with
   yesterday's contents archived.
7. **In-memory iteration marker.** Restarting the server resets
   the marker to "no iteration started" (falls back to the 3-min
   heuristic).

## Roadmap (rough)

- [ ] Bash launcher equivalent for macOS / Linux.
- [ ] Multi-day log aggregation in the session window.
- [ ] In-dashboard help overlay (eliminate the
      "I don't know what blast radius means" UX hole).
- [ ] Optional persistence of the iteration marker.
- [ ] Recursion into git submodules for the import graph.

## Phases (history of the codebase)

Built in five phases, each landing in independently revertable
commits:

| Phase | What it added |
|---|---|
| **F1** | `log-touch` PostToolUse hook + JSONL writer + standalone verifier |
| **F2** | Express server, chokidar watcher, SSE, D3 dashboard |
| **F3** | Import graph + reverse-BFS yellow propagation |
| **F4-A** | Diff modal (hover tooltip + sandboxed git diff + diff2html viewer) |
| **F4-B** | Iteration panel (live metrics + "end iteration" button + Alt+I shortcut) |
| **F5** | Multi-repo: parent-dir scanning, preferences file, first-run wizard, repo selector, auto-switch |
